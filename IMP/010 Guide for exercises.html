            <p>Hi, I have created exercise after each and every lecture. Like i told you before please don't just waste your time watching lectures, try to do all the exercise on your own.</p>

<p>I have added notes to each and every lectures which consist of all the things i explained in the video.So please download it and go through it before starting to do your exercise.<br></p>

<h4><a href="https://repl.it/classroom/invite/CsUacC4" rel="nofollow">https://repl.it/classroom/invite/CsUacC4</a> - Do the exercise here and learn easily.</h4>

<p>You can do the exercise by installing python in your computer or you can use free online IDE for exercise. I have created one classroom in one of the free IDE named <strong></strong><strong>repl.it </strong>. I have added the link to that classroom above which is free of cost. If you use the link do exercise it will be easy for me to see your progress and give you suggestions regarding your code.</p><p><strong>NOTE: Repl.it will ask you sign up for keeping track of your exercise.</strong> </p>

<p>If you need answers or support or any help regarding exercise just let me know i am happy to help you.<br></p>
